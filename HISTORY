Ver 2.0.0 --

(1)  Removed the dll_dbg.h and the dll_main.h headers. They are all in
     the linklist.h header now.

(2)  Made all the tabs in the source files into hard spaces. This was a
     bad habit of mine since I use to set my tabs equal to the equivalent
     of 3 spaces.

(3)  Removed all but the UNIX Makefile since this version will use
     pthreads. Sorry, but if some one wants to do the threads for Mac or
     Windows let me know.

(4)  In order to make this library thread safe I needed to make two hidden
     functions: _addRecord and _deleteEntireList. These are called by other
     functions in the library and as such can not have mutex locks in them
     since it would create a deadlock situation. The locks are in the
     functions: DLL_DeleteEntireList, DLL_AddRecord, and in other functions
     that call the hidden functions.

(5)  There is now a return value for DLL_DestroyList to permit an error in
     a destroy read/write lock to be interrogated.

(6)  

Ver 1.1.0 -- July 05, 1999

(1)  Added four new functions DLL_GetCurrentIndex(), DLL_InsertRecord(),
     DLL_SwapRecord(), and DLL_FindNthRecord()--read the docs on how to
     use these functions.  The basic idea for these functions came from
     Graham Inchley.

(2)  Updated the dll_test program so it could test the new functions.

(3)  Fixed a bug in DLL_AddRecord() where if the Node malloc failed it
     wouldn't free the previous Info malloc-ed structure.

(4)  Re-wrote DLL_AddRecord() so it would execute faster in some
     situations. You probably will never notice anything but it was
     easy to do and made the code simpler.

(5)  Removed some redundant statements from DLL_FindRecord().

(6)  Fixed the sym-links to the library and created a script (demo.sh)
     to run dll_test using the libraries just built instead of defaulting
     to a pre-installed version.

(7)  Re-wrote DLL_GetSearchModes() so it is now thread safe.  This will
     break some code, see the docs. NOTE: This library is not yet
     threaded.

(8)  The documentation source is now in LaTeX2e.  It is converted into a
     postscript file and html pages.

(8)  The Makefile has been completely worked over (still not using GNU
     config) with installs and uninstalls for everything.

Ver 1.0.3 -- November 04, 1998

(1) The package is now covered by the Artistic License, see the
    README and Artistic files.

(2) Minor (non-programic) changes to dll_test.c

(3) Added a README file with notice of the new License.

(4) Re-wrote the MSC6.0 Makefile

Ver 1.0.2 -- October 18, 1998

NOTE: The following changes were only made to the Linux Makefile.

(1) Changed Makefile to incorporate Mac compile options--changes
    contributed by Charlie Buckheit.

(2) Added -fomit-frame-pointer in non-debugging compilation modes.

(3) I now delete the old shared library from the install path before
    copying the new one.

Ver 1.0.1 -- June 08, 1998 -- Minor bug fix

(1) DLL_DestroyList() will now exit gracefully if passed a pointer to a 
    NULL pointer.  This condition was never trapped in version 1.0.

(2) Version numbers now include a second decimal point.

(3) Added this history file.

Ver 1.0 -- January 08, 1998 -- Initial release of version in the Linux
                               Journal.
