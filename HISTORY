Doubly Link List History File (Carl J. Nobile)

Ver 1.1.0 -- April 

(1)  Added four new functions DLL_GetCurrentIndex(), DLL_InsertRecord(),
     DLL_SwapRecord(), and DLL_FindNthRecord()--read the docs on how to
     use these functions.  The basic idea for these functions came from
     Graham Inchley.

(2)  Updated the dll_test program so it could test the new functions.

(3)  Fixed a bug in DLL_AddRecord() where if the Node malloc failed it
     wouldn't free the previous Info malloc-ed structure.

(4)  Re-wrote DLL_AddRecord() so it would execute faster in some
     situations. You probably will never notice anything but it was
     easy to do and made the code simpler.

(5)  Removed some redundant statements from DLL_FindRecord().

(6)  Fixed the sym-links to the library and created a script (demo.sh)
     to run dll_test using the libraries just built instead of defaulting
     to a pre-installed version.

Ver 1.0.3 -- November 04, 1998

(1) The package is now covered by the Artistic License, see the
    README and Artistic files.

(2) Minor (non-programic) changes to dll_test.c

(3) Added a README file with notice of the new License.

(4) Re-wrote the MSC6.0 Makefile

Ver 1.0.2 -- October 18, 1998

NOTE: The following changes were only made to the Linux Makefile.

(1) Changed Makefile to incorporate Mac compile options--changes
    contributed by Charlie Buckheit.

(2) Added -fomit-frame-pointer in non-debugging compilation modes.

(3) I now delete the old shared library from the install path before
    copying the new one.

Ver 1.0.1 -- June 08, 1998 -- Minor bug fix

(1) DLL_DestroyList() will now exit gracefully if passed a pointer to a 
    NULL pointer.  This condition was never trapped in version 1.0.

(2) Version numbers now include a second decimal point.

(3) Added this history file.

Ver 1.0 -- January 08, 1998 -- Initial release
