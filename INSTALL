To install use tar to extract the files into the directory where you
want it to reside.  Usually in /usr/local/src.

tar -xvzf linklist-1.0.3.tar.gz -C /your/path

The above tar command only works with GNU tar.  If you don't have this
tar try:

cp linklist-1.0.3.tar.gz /your/path
cd /your/path
gzcat linklist-1.0.3.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Next cd to the linklist.x.x.x directory and type one of the following,
assuming you're using the GNU compiler:

make            creates a shared library

or

make static     creates a static library.

Read the Makefile for further compilation options.

To install the library in the /usr/local/lib directory enter either
make install or make install-static.  To install the docs enter
make install-docs.  The default directory is /usr/docs/linklist.x.x.x.
Edit the Makefile if you want a different directories.

NOTES:

1) IMPORTANT -- If you do not change the PREFIX environment in the Makefile
   the libraries and the header file will be put into /usr/local/... This
   means that when The Makefile runs ldconfig it may not actually do anything
   unless you have put /usr/local/lib in your /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ directory. I
   generally just make a file named local.conf with /usr/local/lib in it. Older
   systems just put everything in the /etc/ld.so.conf file itself.

2) If you have an old version of the library installed the test program
   (dll_test) will pull that library in when shared objects are used.  If
   you want to test the new library use the demo.sh script instead of running
   the test program directly.  The script will set the environment correctly.

3) The makefiles for the djgpp and MS6.0 compilers have not been tested for
   years.  I doubt if they work any more and none of the new stuff has been
   added to them.  I've left them in the distribution for those daring soles
   who might want to use them.

The documentation is now much more complete.  This distribution now provides a
postscript, pdf, and html versions of the documentation.
