Installation of linklist-1.0.3.tar.gz for Linux                Nov 04 1998

To install use tar to extract the files into the directory where you
want it to reside.

tar -xvzf linklist-1.0.3.tar.gz -C /your/path

Next cd to the linklist directory and type one of the following,
assuming you're using the GNU compiler:

make            creates a shared library

or

make static     creates a static library.

Read the Makefile for further compilation options.

To install the library in the /usr/local/lib directory enter either
make install or make install-static.  Edit the Makefile if you want
a different directory.
