VERSION NUMBERS

I feel an explanation of how the version numbers for the package change is
important so we all know what to expect in future releases.  The major
number (1 at this time) changes when there is a paradigm shift in the way
the package works (See below TO-DO).  There could be incompatibilities
with code written using different major number versions.  The middle
number changes when important new features are added and the minor version
number changes generally for bug fixes.  There should be no
incompatibilities between mid and minor version changes.

COMPILATION

Not much to say here, the package is fairly easy to compile and use. Read
the docs for how to use the API.  The INSTALL file explains how to compile
and install/uninstall the package.

LIBRARY USAGE

When new code is compiled it will link to libdll.so, and when a program
executes it will look for libdll.so.1.  This is why they are sym-linked
to libdll.so.1.1.0 the current version.

TO-DO

I'm am thinking about writing perl, python, and/or tcl extensions.  If you
would find any or all of these extensions useful send me a note, it might
push the process along some.

I am planning a change the major version also.  At present the linklist
defaults to doing memory allocations for each node created. This is
wasteful of resources and time consuming.  It is my hope to create a
mechanism to allow larger blocks of memory to be allocated which can be
changed on the fly.  This should drastically speed up operations.

WEB SITE

Yes I finally have a web site for this at:
