Not much to say here, the package is fairly easy to compile and use. Read
the dll_API.doc.ps file for how to use the API.  The INSTALL file explains
how to compile and install the package.

I'm hoping to write a perl extension for it sometime in the next six
months (today is 11/04/98), but I'm still learning perl so drop me an
e-mail if you would like to see a perl extension.
